# The Impossible Parkour

Parkour game made in Unity within a week, featuring 5 levels. As the name suggests, the game is unnecessarily difficult. Unfortunately, I lost the Unity project a long time ago, so only this build remains.

Notes:
- The music is questionable; you may turn it off if you decide to play this game.
- If you finish the game, you will get to see the secret message at the end that even I don't know what it says (it has been such a long time since I last beat the game).
